                <li>A4 paper</li>
                <li>Your hands</li>

            <p>Using the fold line as a guide take the two corners of the page and match them <br>
            together at the center (fold line) now take the triangle that has been made and <br>
            fold them down. Now, we do the same thing as before, we take the corners and match them<br>
            together at the center using the fold line as a guide. Our plane is almost finished.</p>
